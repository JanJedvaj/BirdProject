MissingOutputException in rule healthcheck in file "C:\Users\Jan\birdpipe-observation-pipeline\Snakefile", line 20:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
out/.pipeline/healthcheck.ok (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
